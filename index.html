        <h1>Street Art SF Tour</h1>
          <p>In recent years San Francisco has taken an active role on trying to eliminate         
          graffiti. City policies have enforced strict regulations on private property owners to 
          buff vandalism and enacted tougher surveillance and punishments on the writers. 
          Graffiti some street artists now paints many legal murals and sell canvases in 
          galleries, most artists still highlight that the practice is fundamentally rooted in 
          both an unsanctioned approach and the aesthetics of the tag. There remains in most 
          street artist's mind a balance between two worlds.</p>
