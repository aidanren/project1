        <h3>Location: 3543 18th Street</h3>
        <p>Called <em>Mastrapeace,</em> this large mural was painted in 1994 by seven female 
        artists, this mural focuses on multi-cultural, cross-generation issues faced by women. It is intended to represent the diverse community in the Bay Area.</p>
        <p>The mural was painted by uana Alicia, Miranda Bergman, Edythe Boone, Susan Kelk 
        Cervantes, Meera Desai, Yvonne Littleton and Irene Perez, and other volunteers. The 
        overarching theme of the imagery is this: the healing power of women's wisdom over time, 
        the contributions of women throughout history, and the making of history by women from 
        all corners of the earth. Other women who have their likeness represented in the mural 
        are Audre Lorde, Georgia O'Keefe, Rigoberta Menchu, Quan Yin, Yemeyah, and Coyoxauqui.</p>
